# Hey there!

UI and UX designer transitioning into frontend development.  
I design systems, then ship them.

## 🧠 About
I focus on clean interfaces, clear structure, and practical execution.  
My work sits at the intersection of design systems, frontend logic, and documentation that actually makes sense.

Currently building small, focused projects to sharpen fundamentals and ship consistently.

## 🛠️ Stack
Design  
Figma, Design Systems, UX Documentation

Frontend  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Workflow  
Git, GitHub, Notion

## 🧪 What I am working on
1. Reusable UI components built from scratch  
2. Small frontend experiments focused on layout and interaction  
3. Improving documentation and README quality across projects

## 📌 Featured Projects
Check the pinned repositories below.  
Each project is scoped, documented, and intentionally designed.
